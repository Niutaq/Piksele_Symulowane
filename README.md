<big>**Simulation Game Project**</big><br> <br> <br>
The simulation game is a project written in C++ and utilizing the SFML library for graphics and multimedia. The entire codebase is stored in a repository, with all necessary files, including the main application and other related files, neatly organized within the "files" folder. Additionally, the repository contains a .sln file for easy project management within a Visual Studio IDE. The "data" folder houses essential resources such as images, fonts, and other related assets required for the game's visual.

The game is designed to be user-friendly, with a PDF instruction manual available both within the game and as a separate downloadable document. Currently at version 0.1, the game is in its early stages of development, and users can simply download the .exe program and launch it to start playing. The intuitive design and straightforward installation process make it accessible to a wide range of users.

For developers interested in diving into the codebase, the game also includes Doxygen documentation, providing detailed insights into the code structure and functionality. While the primary language of the game is Polish, the Doxygen documentation can serve as a valuable resource for understanding the code, provided the reader is familiar with the Polish language. ;)
